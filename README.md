# Water-level-indicator
Water coming out of the water filter is wasted. Instead we could collect this water in a container. However the  container may over flow. Hence, I tried to devise a water level indicator using Arduino, GSM 800C and ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to send text messages when the container was full.
